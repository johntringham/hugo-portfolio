        <br/>
        <i>Two Player</i> was created as part of the 7DFPS Game Jam. It was made solo, using Unity and <a href="https://fernandoramallo.itch.io/doodle-studio-95">Doodle Studio 95</a>.

        A pass-time I enjoy is to experiment with new rendering techniques, usually with Unity's shadergraph or via HLSL/GLSL shaders.
        <br/>
        These experiments have included grey-scott reaction diffusion techniques, "slime mould" rendering systems, and other novel methods.
